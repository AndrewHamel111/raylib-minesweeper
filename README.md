# raylib-minesweeper/tree/enhanced
This is the 'enhanced' branch. I am using this to continue some additional work on the project for a planned future video. Feel free to clone and build, but beware it may not work 100% ðŸ˜…

Some features will include larger grids, panning and zooming, added sound effects (as recommended in the video), and more!
