# raylib-minesweeper
A super-duper basic minesweeper in all raylib's pure-C glory!

This repo was created as a resource for my [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-EYrPRdjp4) on [Andrew Hamel Codes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCETp9EybHuo0AM6tZMzdHxA).

Don't think of this as a game, but instead a minimum-implementation of Minesweeper. There isn't much code here whatsoever, so expanding it to add some fancy animations, sound effects, a kind of leaderboard (whatever you'd like, really) could be easy! To get this baseline implementation only took ~90 minutes, and to expand it more wouldn't take much. The game already supports an arbitrary number of rows / columns and can scale to any screen size that is hardcoded at the top of main.

Of course, if you really wanted to, you [could play it](https://andrewhamel.ca/games/minesweeper/).

Don't worry, it's still possible to suck!

# Building and Playing
If you really wanted to try it out, you can follow my instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6THkPkF2I&t=1307s) to get setup with raylib and compile the game for yourself. If you don't need to edit the code, there's an online-hosted version [on my website here](https://andrewhamel.ca/games/minesweeper/), though there are much better versions of minesweeper online for you to play.

# raylib-minesweeper/tree/enhanced
You may notice an 'enhanced' branch. I am using this to continue some additional work on the project for a planned future video. Feel free to clone and build, but beware it may not work 100% ðŸ˜…

Some features will include larger grids, panning and zooming, added sound effects (as recommended in the video), and more!
